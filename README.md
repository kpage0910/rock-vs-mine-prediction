# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Sonar Data

## Overview
A machine learning model using logistic regression to predict whether underwater objects are rocks or mines based on sonar signals. The model achieved 83% accuracy on training data and 76% accuracy on test data.

## Dataset
- 208 sonar signal samples
- 60 numerical features (sonar frequencies)
- Binary classification: Rock (R) or Mine (M)

## Requirements
```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure
- Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb (Main notebook)
- sonar data.csv (Dataset)

## Quick Start
1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook
3. Model will:
   - Load and process sonar data
   - Train logistic regression model

## Results
- Training accuracy: 83%
- Test accuracy: 76%
